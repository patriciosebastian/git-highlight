## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patriciosebastian/git-highlight.git ~/.git-highlight
   ```

2. Add the script to your `.zshrc` file:

	This will source the git-highlight script on every new Zsh session, ensuring the highlighting feature is always active:

   ```bash
   echo "" >> ~/.zshrc && echo "source ~/.git-highlight/git-highlight.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

	If you'd rather add it manually, just open your `.zshrc` (located in your home directory) and append:

	```
	source ~/.git-highlight/git-highlight.zsh
	```

3. Refresh your terminal:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Using a Zsh Plugin Manager

If youâ€™re using a Zsh plugin manager like [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug), add the following line to your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
zplug "patriciosebastian/git-highlight"
```

Then, reload your terminal:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Customization

You can customize Git Highlight by editing the `git-highlight.zsh` file.

### Modify Valid Git Commands

To add or remove recognized commands, edit the `validGitCommands` array:

```bash
typeset -a validGitCommands=(git init commit push pull status checkout merge branch fetch rebase diff add log stash pop restore reset)
```

Add more commands:

```bash
validGitCommands+=(blame cherry-pick worktree)
```

### Update Shell Operators

To handle additional shell operators, edit the case block:

```bash
case "$word" in
  '&&'|'||'|';'|'&')
    expect_subcommand=false
    ;;
esac
```
